# Stage 1 — Research Brand Anatomy

Produce one evidence-backed source-brand model, finalize it in Storybook, and stop for user review.

## Normative contract

- Before starting, read [the pipeline specification](../../../docs/brand-research-pipeline-spec.md), [the evidence model](references/evidence-and-layer-model.md), [the source schema](references/source-anatomy-schema.md), [the global system framework](references/global-brand-system-framework.md), [the report language rules](references/report-language-style.md), [the JSON contract](references/brand-model-json-contract.md), and [the Storybook report contract](../reconstruct-brand-system/references/storybook-report-contract.md).
- The JSON is canonical. Storybook is the only human-readable report surface.
- Never create or preserve an `outputs/*.html` report, brand-specific report CSS, or report screenshot.
- Record only `Observed` and `Inferred`; never add a target brand, transfer, fictional name, or target token.
- Feed the fixed color-swatch and typography-hierarchy blocks with scoped observed values. Remote fonts are report-only provenance (`documentation_only: true`) and must never modify starter-kit theme tokens; use an explicit gap when loading is unavailable.
- Synthesize the fixed verbal hierarchy from evidence already collected: purpose, essence, positioning, promise, core values, brand message, voice, and activation/proof. Use explicit gaps instead of extending the rapid research window.
- Never use Playwright, Chrome MCP, or browser automation unless the user explicitly requests it.

### Lean research rules (pipeline spec §2.1)

- **≤4 core sources**. Pick the highest-signal pages: official homepage, brand guide/about, hero product page, and one social or press source. Stop collecting once you have 4.
- **ego-browser first**. Check `which ego-browser`. If installed, use it as the primary collection tool for navigating brand sites and capturing evidence. If not installed, ask the user: "ego-browser를 설치하면 브랜드 사이트를 직접 탐색해 더 정확한 자료를 모을 수 있습니다. `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/ego-browser`로 설치할까요?" If declined, fall back to web search and `fetch`.
- **No blank fields**. Omit any section, claim, or token slot that has no supporting evidence. Do not produce `TBD`, `N/A`, placeholder text, or empty arrays.
- **No duplicate images**. Before saving a visual, check if the same image (by URL or visual content) already exists in `visual-corpus.csv`. Skip duplicates.

## Initialize and start the timer

```bash
python3 scripts/init_analysis.py <analysis-directory>
python3 scripts/research_timebox.py start <analysis-directory> --mode rapid --minutes 10
```

Required package artifacts:

- `research-run.json`
- `research-brief.yaml`
- `source-manifest.csv`
- `visual-corpus.csv`
- local evidence images and useful contact sheets
- `source-brand-anatomy.md`
- `grammar-kernel.md`
- `analysis-handoff.yaml`
- `analysis-status.yaml`
- `stage-review.json`
- `outputs/source-brand-analysis.json`

## Research depth

Use `rapid` unless the user explicitly requests a deeper study. Rapid mode caps sources at 4 and omits sections without evidence.

| Mode | Core sources | Local visuals | Grammar rules | Time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| rapid | ≤4 | from collected sources only | 3–5 | 10 minutes maximum |
| expanded | ≤8 | 40–60 | 5–8 | explicit user exception |

Expanded mode requires the user's explicit request in `expanded_depth_rationale` and does not claim the rapid SLA.

## Rapid procedure

### Minute 0–1 — Scope lock

Fill `research-brief.yaml`. Use the current global masterbrand when scope is clear. Ask at most one question only when entity, era, or portfolio scope would materially change the result.

For a routed pipeline, the root now runs `plan_stage_jobs.py` and dispatches the three generated Stage 1 research specs concurrently. Every lane receives the same Stage deadline. Workers write only `.work/<job-id>/result.json`; the root records job state sequentially, stops all searching at minute 6, deduplicates URLs and evidence, and writes the canonical anatomy. Do not add a second research wave merely because workers are available.

### Minute 1–6 — Evidence

Lead with current first-party evidence using ego-browser (preferred) or web search. Collect at most 4 core sources — stop when you have them. Save representative local visuals from those sources only; do not hunt for additional image sources. Preserve source URL, capture date, credit, rights note, local path, and hash. No duplicate images.

Register one official masterbrand logo and its verified identity-color field. Keep identity, key visual, brand mood, photography, product representation, and product-native language separate. If a layer has no evidence from the 4 sources, omit it entirely.

### Minute 6–8 — Anatomy and grammar

Use [the anatomy template](assets/source-brand-anatomy.md). Write only sections that have supporting evidence — omit empty sections entirely. Distill 3–5 causal grammar rules from what was found. Each material claim needs evidence, confidence, an alternative, and scope or exception. Missing coverage becomes an explicit unresolved gap but does not create a blank section.

At minute 8 run:

```bash
python3 scripts/research_timebox.py check <analysis-directory>
```

Do not start new evidence searches after this checkpoint.

### Minute 8–10 — Export and finalize

Fill handoff metadata, export the canonical JSON, compute digests, complete the timer, then use the single finalization command from the starter-kit root:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_brand_model.py <analysis-directory>
python3 scripts/package_digests.py <analysis-directory> # copy the printed block into analysis-handoff.yaml
python3 scripts/research_timebox.py complete <analysis-directory> --reason coverage_complete
pnpm finalize-brand-report -- <analysis-directory>
```

`finalize-brand-report` runs Stage validation, enforces the exact React section contract, registers JSON/review/assets, generates the CSF story, and checks registration drift. Do not run a separate renderer or hand-edit generated Storybook files.

This finalizer is the only validation entrypoint. Never run `validate_analysis.py` separately before or after it. If finalization passes, do not manually reread the package, recount evidence, recompute digests, or run an extra audit. If it fails, change only the reported canonical artifact or provenance issue and rerun the finalizer after that change.

## Delivery checkpoint

Set `current_stage: SOURCE_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Report one compact status line — `Stage 1 finalization PASS — canonical data, local evidence, fixed React report, and Storybook registration match; review pending.` — then provide the Storybook story path, canonical JSON path, and the single adjustment prompt from `stage-review.json`. Do not enumerate internal validator categories unless the user asks. Record `accepted` or `revision_requested`; deterministic validation is not approval.

When the package is routed and the user responds, use the router's `advance_pipeline.py`. A revision remains in Stage 1. Acceptance re-registers the accepted review before Stage 2 begins.
